# CMIP6 Hackathon Project: SO Overturning and Sea Ice

This is the repository for the CMIP6 Southern Ocean bottom water formation and sea ice extent hackathon project.
The goal of this project is to diagnose the SO bottom water formation in CMIP6 models and the impact this has on the overturning and transport in the region. We also hope to see whether there are links between bottom water formation and sea ice concentration and whether there are any mechanisms that link the two, perhaps through overturning or transport. 


### What's included?

1. `catalogs`: data catalogs that can be used by Intake-ESM.
1. `environments`: Conda environment files for the NCAR/Google Cloud deployments.
1. `notebooks`: a place for storing Jupyter Notebooks.
1. `README.md`: short project description
1. `LICENSE`: a default (MIT) license file for your project. You can change this if you feel the need.


Once the initial setup is done, everyone will want to clone the repository onto the compute system they plan to use for the hackathon.

1. Open a JupyterLab session on the system you plan to use.
1. Open a terminal in the JupyterLab environment.
1. Clone your project: `git clone https://github.com/username/cmip6hack-myproject.git`
1. Get to work!


### How to make your project citable

[Zenodo](https://about.zenodo.org/) is a data archiving tool that can help make your project citable by assigning a DOI to the project's GitHub repository.
